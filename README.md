# Recreation of the popular game of Jeopardy

## Fully interactive game of Jeopardy with designated questions and answers with points assigned to each question

This project is a  showcase of my Javascript and Html and Css knowledge. It is a fully functional game of Jeopardy with different rounds of questions that are assigned with answers. Each round has a point threshold that a player needs to cross to proceed to the next round.

Languages used in this project are the following :

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

Note: If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio it is recommended to use the extension Live Server to run the code as intended.
